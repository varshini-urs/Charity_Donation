# Charity Blockchain Project

### Problem Statement
- There are no platforms that can be used by charities to ensure security while providing accessibility to maximum people.
- The biggest problem faced is transparency, where people can rightly exercise their Right To Information by asking for a record of expenditure by the charity
- Even if such applications are available, they are inaccessible to smaller organisations with a good user interface for ease of access.
